== Welcome to Pario

Pario is a Gosu Game framework that helps to give you structure and a start for creating games. 

== Getting Started

1. At the command prompt, create a new Pario game
  <tt>pario new my_game</tt> (where <tt>my_game</tt> is the game name)

2. Change the directory to <tt>my_game</tt> and start the game
  <tt>cd my_game</tt>
  <tt>pario play</tt>

3. To create more classes for your game (which will appear in the game folder)
 <tt>gosu add my_class</tt> (where <tt>my_class</tt> is the name of your class)
 
  Also, just as <tt>new</tt>, subsequent words will more classes. 
  However, the game folder will not create subfolders but relate the classes automatically.
  <tt>pario new my_class menu background</tt>
